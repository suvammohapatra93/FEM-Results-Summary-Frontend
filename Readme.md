Interactive Visualization: View FEM results through graphs, charts, and 3D models, including stress, strain, and displacement fields.
Data Filtering: Select specific simulation parameters, time steps, or nodes to refine the displayed data.
Responsive Design: Optimized for both desktop and mobile devices.
Custom Styling: Clean and intuitive interface with dynamic styling.

# Technologies Used

HTML: Structure of the website, including layout of various sections such as the upload panel, visualization areas, and result summaries.
CSS: Custom styling for a modern, responsive design, ensuring an engaging user experience across devices.
JavaScript: Handles core functionality such as data uploading, parsing, and real-time interaction with the visualized FEM results.

# How to Use

Open the Website: Access the website via your browser by opening the index.html file.
Upload FEM Data: Use the upload button to select and upload your FEM result files. Supported formats include .csv, .txt, etc.
Visualize Results: Once the data is uploaded, various visualization options will become available, allowing you to view charts, graphs, and other representations of the simulation results.
Interact with the Data: Use the built-in tools to zoom, pan, and filter through the simulation data to focus on key aspects of your analysis.

### FEM(FINITE ELEMENT METHOD)

The finite element method (FEM) is a numerical technique that uses a finite representation to approximate a continuous system. The FEM breaks down a system into a grid of nodes, which are connected by elements. The elements represent the system's behavior between the nodes. The FEM uses partial differential equations (PDEs) to generate predictions of an object's behavior.
The FEM has many applications, including:
Fluid-structure interaction
Thermomechanical, thermochemical, and thermo-chemo-mechanical problems
Biomechanics
Biomedical engineering
Piezoelectric, ferroelectric, and electromagnetics
